          <span class="card-title"> <h3> Raising Minimum Wage Hasn’t Hurt States </h3></span>
 <div class="card-content"><p>CRITICS CALL IT A job-killer. Proponents say it’s a long-overdue move to share near-record corporate profits with workers who haven’t seen a mandated wage increase in more than 10 years, a record stretch. And others say it’s warranted in higher-cost states, but makes no sense in states where the price of housing, groceries and transportation is lower.

Raising the minimum wage evokes a passionate response from all sides, and the argument is growing more heated now that the House of Representatives has voted to more than double the federal minimum age from $7.25 an hour to $15 hourly by 2024. State by state, the minimum wage varies dramatically – from the federally mandated cellar of $7.25 in a swath of Southern states, plus rural states such as Idaho and Utah, to $11.10 in New York and up to $12 an hour in California. As of this year, 21 states require businesses (with some exceptions, such as tipped jobs) to pay above the federal minimum.

Was it worth it for those states to raise the minimum wage? Data collected by U.S. News as well as detailed studies by economists indicates it was – or at least that hiking the minimum wage has not hurt the state economies.</p></div>
